For this first portion of the project, we have completed a functioning User Interface as well as having our hardware set up. Our User Interface has a log in page, a page that updated based on the status of the door, as well has alerting the user via the app if there was activity with the doorbell, and an advanced settings page that enables the auto lock feature. The user also has the ability to create an account if they choose. In terms of hardware, we have implemented the hobby servo motor as we would like it to be used for the lock, as well as the button that will act as the doorbell feature of the project. For right now, we have configured interaction between the doorbell and the lock. We had some issues troubleshooting the full functionality of the servo motor as well as making the UI look as we had imagined, but so far the issues have not been too invasive. In terms of priorities for the next week, we would like to implement the cloud capabilities as well as potentially building out a physically cardboard door to demonstrate our product. This should be reasonable for the scope of our project over the next week.
